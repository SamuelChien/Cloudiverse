<h3>Agenda</h3>

<p>There are two parts to the Disrupt Hackathon:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Hacking</strong>, where over 800 hackers will build something awesome from scratch between 12:30pm Saturday to 10:00am Sunday. </li>
<li><strong>The Demoing</strong>, where the hacks will be demoed before judges, the media, other hackers and the public.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Hacking</h3>

<p>Hackers will build something awesome from scratch, either individually or in teams. </p>

<p>Since you're short on time and the aim is to impress the judges and win some of the awesome prizes on offer, you're encouraged to make heavy use of <a href="/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2013/wikipages/520517c876ab293895000028">APIs and resources</a> (see the links on the left). We'll also have a series of <a href="/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2013/wikipages/5205177676ab293895000027">API workshops on Saturday afternoon</a> with experts on hand to answer your questions and keep you hacking, not scratching your head.</p>

<p>Each Hack will need to be registered on our platform as a Project; you and your team-mates will also need to register as users on our platform (powered by <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org">HackerLeague</a>).</p>

<p><em>Creating (and later submitting) your project is the only way you'll be able to get to demo your hack (and win prizes and free tickets to Disrupt) on Sunday</em>.</p>

<h3>The Demoing</h3>

<p>You'll have until 10:00am on Sunday, September 8th submit your project/hack. When you submit your hack, you'll be given a number which is the order in which you'll present your hack.</p>

<p>At 11:00am, presentations will begin in the main hall.  You will bring your device onto the stage, and have 1 minute to demo your hack.  If you take longer than one minute, you will be publicly embarrassed.  </p>

<p>Three hacks will be selected by the judges for demoing during this week's Disrupt conference.</p>

<p>One hack will be awarded $5k for the Best Hack of the event.</p>

<p>Each team that demos their Hack on stage on Sunday will be eligible for two tickets to the main Disrupt conference, valued at almost $3000 each.</p>
